### About

Alex started learning to program in the 80s in an era of classic home computers that allowed you to get down and dirty at the system level. After graduating with a degree in Chemistry heâ€™s worked on a variety of projects including Fruit Machines, Line Cards, CCTV recorders and point-to-multipoint wireless microwave systems. Since the turn of the century his primary focus has been working with FLOSS platforms, especially Linux. For the last five years heâ€™s been working at Linaro helping improve QEMUâ€™s emulation features. A keen Emacs user he will happily answer questions and proselytise for the One True Editor (tm).
